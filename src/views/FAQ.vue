              Every weapon skin in CSGO has a float value ranging from
              <strong>0.0</strong> to <strong>1.0</strong>, which describes its
              wear. Here <strong>0</strong> means the skin is in perfect
              condition, and as the value increases to <strong>1</strong>, its
              condition degrades gradually. Float values are fixed and assigned
              automatically whenever the skin is dropped or received by opening
              cases.

              Although Steam does not display the float value in market listings
              and in the game, rather they display the wear condition derived by
              it. But it is still possible to check it using 3rd-party tools.

              To check the float value of a skin, you can use our tool. It's
              pretty simple to use, just copy the inspect link and paste it in
              the input box and then click on <strong>Check</strong> button.

              Just as every weapon skin in CSGO has a float value, it also has a
              wear level/condition also called as exterior quality. This wear
              level is nothing but a representation of the float value. There
              are five levels ranging from best to worst:

              As the level goes down, the skin appears to be scratched and has
              missing textures.
